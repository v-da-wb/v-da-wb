## 👋 About Me

💡 I am a **results-driven Data Analyst** with **6+ years of experience**, passionate about **efficiency and process optimisation**. My constant drive to ask, *“How can we make this more efficient?”* has led me to master automation and data analytics using **Python, VBA, and SQL**.

🔍 With strong proficiency in **Python, R, SQL, Tableau/Dashboards**, and **Advanced Excel**, I extract insights from complex datasets and craft compelling narratives that drive decision-making. Completing a **Level 7 non-credit bearing Data Analytics CPD course at LSE** sharpened my technical and storytelling skills.

🤝 Known for my **collaborative mindset**, rapid learning, and advanced technical acumen, I transform projects into high-quality, intelligent, and autonomous processes. My background in **economic and financial reporting, academic research**, and **stakeholder communication** consistently earns recognition for delivering **impactful, actionable insights**.
